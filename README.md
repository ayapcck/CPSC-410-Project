# CPSC-410-Project

### Making changes

1. Checkout this repo onto your local machine
2. Create a new branch off of the current master branch (branches should be for a specific feature)
   * This is done by `git checkout -B <branch-name-here>`
3. Make changes on this branch
4. Commit changes to this branch and push to github
   * The first push is must use `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name-here>`
5. When the feature is complete, create a Pull Request against the master branch
6. Get some of the team (preferably all members) to approve the Pull Request **BEFORE** merging
   * This allows the team to understand the changes that are being introduced to the master branch
