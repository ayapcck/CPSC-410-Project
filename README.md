# CPSC-410-Project

### Making changes

1. Checkout this repo onto your local machine
2. Create a new branch off of the current master branch (branches should be for a specific feature)
   * This is done by `git checkout -B <branch-name-here>`
3. Make changes on this branch
4. Commit changes to this branch and push to github
   * The first push is must use `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name-here>`
5. When the feature is complete, create a Pull Request against the master branch
6. Get some of the team (preferably all members) to approve the Pull Request **BEFORE** merging
   * This allows the team to understand the changes that are being introduced to the master branch

### Issues and Projects (Github tools)
We can use the Github Issues and Projects tabs in this repo as a means to keep track of the outstanding bugs and features left in the project. If something new crops up, please create a new 'Issue' and link it to the 410 Project. You can feel free to assign an Issue to yourself if you want. When working on a task, please move the Issue into the 'In Progress' column in the project dashboard. I believe you can link a PR to a certain issue, please do that when creating a PR so that everyone can easily figure out what is relating to what.
